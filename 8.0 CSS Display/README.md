### 4 Types of CSS Display Property

1. block - block means that the block will take up the whole horizontal space of the web page.    
it's by default.

2. inline - inline means that the block will take up the only that much space which is required for the content from the web page.   
we can fit muliple block in the same line.    
we cannot change *height* and *width*   
until the web page doesn't have space then it will go to the next line.

3. inline-block - inline-block means it will be behave same as inline but we can change height and width.   
it's a combination of both inline and block. 

4. none - it will disappear block from the web page
