### How to use float ?
Float is use to wrap thing around.

if we use things around img it will wrap other block around the image   

Two types of float - ```float: left;``` and ```float: right;```

if we want to clear float from any tags we can use ```clear: left;```, ```clear: right;```, ```clear: both;```

**IMPORTANT MENTION   
In today's world we use float generally for around img tag and left right
