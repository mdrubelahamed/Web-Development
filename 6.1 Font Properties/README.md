- font size
  - 1px = 1/96 inch = 0.26 mm (1 pixel)
  - 1pt = 1/72 inch = 0.72 mm (1 point)
  - 1em = 100% of parent = (1 m)
    it a relative size, if parent of the element is changed it will affect this element
  - 1 rem = 100% of root(1 rem), it a relative size, if parent of the element is changed it will affect this element

-  px: A pixel is a single dot on a screen. It is an absolute unit of measurement and is not scalable. For example, `font-size: 16px;` sets the font size to 16 pixels.

- pt: A point is a unit of length used in typography. It is an absolute unit of measurement and is not scalable. For example, `font-size: 12pt;` sets the font size to 12 points.

- em: An em is a relative unit of measurement. It is based on the font size of the parent element. For example, if the font size of the parent element is 16 pixels, `font-size: 1em;` sets the font size to 16 pixels. If the font size of the parent element is 20 pixels, `font-size: 1em;` sets the font size to 20 pixels.

- rem: A rem is also a relative unit of measurement, but it is based on the font size of the root element. The root element is usually the `<html>` element. For example, if the font size of the root element is 16 pixels, `font-size: 1rem;` sets the font size to 16 pixels. If the font size of the root element is 20 pixels, `font-size: 1rem;` sets the font size to 20 pixels.
